comments:
  - The code is nicely styled and concise
  - Generally the code is clear enough, but documentation could be improved by including more comments
  - The sequence, selection and iteration used in the methods are appropriate
  - Methods and variables are properly named. The local variables in Task 2 could be named to be more informative which would improve the style.
  - The style is consistent throughout
  - The code does not appear to have errors and functions as expected
