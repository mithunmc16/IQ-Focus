# Write a list of review comments here.
#
comments:
  - The code is well structured and has consistent style throughout
  - The code contains is well documented, some comments could be more descriptive
  - The code is clear in places where there are no comments
  - Local variables and methods are appropriately named
  - Using isPlacementStringWellFormed method is redundant after using isPlacementStringValid
    (a valid placement string requires that the placement is well formed) -> Can remove the check
    for well formed placements to save time
  - Code functions as intended in all situations
